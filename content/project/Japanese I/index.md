COURSE DESCRIPTION

Course Overview: This course is a continuation of JAPA 100. It focuses on listening, speaking, reading and writing. Students are expected to acquire an appropriate level of competency in these areas.

Our Teaching and Learning Approach: Research shows that one of the best ways to learn a second language is to practice it in “real communication”. To maximize the use of our class time for “real communication” activities, this course requires you to participate in three major components: Pre-class, In-class, and Post-class activities.

Pre-class Activity (Getting a grasp of how the target structures work): You will complete simple self-study activities that help you understand the basic use of grammar and vocabulary before coming to each class, so that you can actively participate in language learning tasks in class. The instructor will provide detailed instructions for the activities for each class. 

In-class Activity (Application of your knowledge to practice): You will practice the actual use of the structures you studied in “Pre-class Activity” by doing various types of tasks in meaningful communication settings. There will be a large amount of pair and group work with your classmates, and your active participation is expected.

Post-class Activity (Assessment of learning and improvement of pronunciation): After class, you will do two types of exercise that help you to (1) assess how much you have learned in class (workbook) and (2) improve your pronunciation and fluency (oral practices in the textbook). Knowing what you know and you don’t know is an essential for your learning. 

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
At the completion of this course, you may expect to:

Speaking: Discuss descriptions/comments related to present & past events, likes/dislikes, family members, future plans for events/holidays, and one’s thoughts on places/things/people, in Japanese by using simple sentence structures;  Ask/offer/make a suggestion to do something & request/grant permission; Discuss rules and regulations; Pass on what someone said to another person; Express a reason for something; Describe people’s appearance; Buy or order items with quantities

Listening: Understand simple questions or statements about descriptions/comments related to present & past events,likes/dislikes, family members, future plans for events/holidays, and one’s thoughts on places/things/people, in Japanese

Writing: Write Hiragana and Katakana and some high frequency Kanji (additional 72 characters); Write a short passage in basic content areas of personal nature (e.g., post card, email message, passage about one’s family members) following the standard Japanese writing format; Write a simple direction to a place

Reading: Read Hiragana and Katakana and high frequency Kanji (additional 72 characters); Read a simple, short passage dealing with some areas of personal information, such as simple letters/postcards/e-mail message and writing on simple information about a place and family members

Communication: Ask to slow down when unable to understand speech; Use basic Japanese interjections & fillers for a smooth oral communication more effectively

Attendance & Participation (8%): Attendance and participation are marked as follows: 2pts: prepared, good/satisfactory participation in activities; 1pt: unprepared, unsatisfactory participation in activities; 0pt: absent. If you are late to class, 0.5 point will be deducted every 10 minutes. You need to consult with your instructor if your attendance rate is lower than 80%.  

Pre-class Activities (5%): Pre-class activities will be available in VIULearn before each class. Your completion of the activities and self-check quizzes (must obtain 80% or higher mark) will be recorded using the progress tracking function in VIULearn. Partially completed activities will not be credited.

Post-class Activities (10%): You do specified sections of your textbook and workbook (or Kanji practice sheet) after class. For the sections of workbook activities, you check all the answers using answer keys after completing all the sections as instructed. You then write necessary corrections as instructed using a red pen. Your work will be collected at the end of each lesson and marked as follows: 2pts: all the pages were completed and carefully corrected, showing your learning process; 1pt: all the pages were completed but not corrected as instructed; 0pt: some pages were incomplete or the answers were obviously copied from the answer keys or someone else’s work.

Mini Quizzes (18%): Missed quizzes can be rescheduled as a re-do at the discretion of the instructor. You must arrange the time for the re-do within 24 hours from the originally scheduled time. In addition, you are allowed to reschedule the missed quizzes twice per semester without a doctor’s note or other supporting documentation. You must write the re-do within two school days from the original date.

Assignments (9%): Writing assignments - 4 assignments (Lesson 5 Part 2, Lesson 6, Reading Break & Lesson 9). These assignments must be completed independently. They are graded based on the following system. 2pts: The work meets the expectations and, although there may be some mistakes, showing students’ effort to do good work; 1pt: The work indicates that the student needs additional assistance from the instructor. Your mark will be revised (1.5pt) if you go over the work with the instructor or if you redo the work; 0pt: no submission of work, or more than 50 % of the work is unfinished. Any late submission without instructor’s permission will be subject to the deduction of 0.4 point per school day.

Midterm Exam (15%): In the mid-February; 75 mins max; written exam. If you have to miss the exam because of medical reasons, you are required to contact me prior to the exam via email. By the following week, I need a certificate of Illness from your medical doctor specifying the date of your absence, the reason, and justification for missing the exam. Instead of having make-up for the exam, the weight of that exam will be added to the final exam. Unexcused absence from the exam will result in a grade of 0.

Final Exam (20%): During the final exam period; 120 mins max; written exam, including a listening section (for 20-25 mins). Please note that, as the university policy stated in the calendar (see the section of “Examination Schedules”), no travel plans should be made during the final exam period.

Oral Test (15%): During the final exam period; 10 to 15 mins, including the time to prepare for each task; Role-play with the instructor; Done individually.

Your final % mark will be converted into a letter grade using the following scale.
A+
100-90
