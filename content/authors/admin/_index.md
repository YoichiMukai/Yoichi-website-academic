### Welcome to my website

I am a linguist (also a director of [Linguistic Research Laboratory](https://ah.viu.ca/lrl)) interested in a range of data-driven research, with a focus on the empirical study of language through experimentation. My primary research interest lies in the underlying mechanisms of speech communication. Although speech is highly variable, speakers and listeners seem to communicate with ease. It is intriguing to study how the production of speech varies and how listeners cope with such variability. My LinguisTree is [here](https://academictree.org/linguistics/tree.php?pid=817024).

This talk was designed for individuals who have no prior knowledge of linguistics but hold an interest in the study of language. The first 15 minutes of the talk provided an introduction to how linguists think and talk about language, and what types of analyses they conduct to understand pieces of language. The remainder of the talk focused on my dissertation research, entitled [Production and perception of reduced speech and the role of phonological-orthographic consistency](https://doi.org/10.7939/r3-x8xz-yr25). Linked here is a published article derived from my dissertation research, entitled [The role of phonology-to-orthography consistency in predicting the degree of pupil dilation induced in processing reduced and unreduced speech](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0142716423000279)
