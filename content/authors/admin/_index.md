I am a faculty member in the Department of Modern Languages at Vancouver Island University, teaching Japanese and linguistics. I recently defended my dissertation, entitled "Production and perception of reduced speech and the role of phonological-orthographic consistency", in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Alberta under the supervision of Drs. [Benjamin V. Tucker](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bvtucker/) and [Juhani JÃ¤rvikivi](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~jarvikiv/).

In my dissertation, I looked at the effect of pronunciation-to-spelling consistency in the recognition of spontaneous Japanese speech for L1 and L2 listeners. More specifically, I examined how phonetic reduction interacts with the effect of consistency. Methodologically, I employed pupillometry, the measurement of pupil dilation, and generalized additive mixed modelling ([Dissertation](https://yoichimukai.rbind.io/papers/Mukai_Yoichi_202009_PhD.pdf), [Presentation](https://youtu.be/8CI_8AITRw4)).
