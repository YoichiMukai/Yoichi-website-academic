### Welcome to my website

I am a linguist who are interested in a range of data-driven research, with a focus on the empirical study of language through experimentation. My primary research interest lies in the underlying mechanisms of speech communication. Although speech is highly variable, speakers and listeners seem to communicate with ease. It is an intriguing question to address how production of speech varies and how listeners cope with such variability. 

This talk was for those who knows nothing about linguistics but interested in language. The first 15 mins of the talk is about how linguists think and talk about language, and what kind of analysis they conduct to understand pieces of language. The rest is about my dissertation research. Here is my dissertation, [Production and perception of reduced speech and the role of phonological-orthographic consistency](https://doi.org/10.7939/r3-x8xz-yr25).
